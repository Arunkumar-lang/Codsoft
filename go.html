        <p>One of the problems in describing a language is the diversity of the people who must understand the description. Among these are initial evaluators, 
            implementors, and users. Most new programming languages are subjected to a 
            period of scrutiny by potential users, often people within the organization that 
            employs the languageâ€™s designer, before their designs are completed. These are 
            the initial evaluators. The success of this feedback cycle depends heavily on the 
            clarity of the description.</p>
